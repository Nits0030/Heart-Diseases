## Data Set 
The dataset is utilized for this research problem is from Kaggle, which is an opensource hub and an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google. The dataset used is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of town Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patient’s information including their heart rate, blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol levels etc. It includes over 4,238 records and 16 attributes.

•	High blood pressure. 
•	High cholesterol. 
•	Cigarette smoking. 
•	Diabetes. 
•	Unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. 
•	Overweight and obesity. 


## Data Analysis 
### Techniques Used
Data Mining is fundamental concern about the analysis of data. Data Mining tools and techniques are utilized for finding patterns from the dataset. The main objective of Data Mining technique is to discover patterns automatically with minimal user information.

1. Classification:

Classification is a technique where it categorizes data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under. Classification is a classic data mining procedure dependent on machine learning. 

2. Clustering: 

Clustering is a data mining procedure that causes important or valuable group of items that to have comparable characteristics utilizing programmed method. Not quite the same as classification, clustering system likewise characterizes the classes and put objects in them, while in classification, objects are assigned out into predefined classes.
